"""Curated evaluation dataset for the Topos grounded chat assistant.

This module is the source of truth for ``scripts/build_eval_dataset.py``.
It defines a fixed, versioned corpus of blog posts and a set of curated
question/answer expectations used to measure how chat prompt or retrieval
changes affect citation quality.

Why a fixed corpus?
-------------------
Grounded chat is only as good as the posts it can retrieve and cite. To make
``expected_post_ids`` deterministic (and therefore a stable eval target) the
corpus below is authored once and versioned alongside the questions. A future
evaluation run indexes these exact posts and checks that the assistant cites
the expected ones.

Post ids
--------
In production, content post ids are MongoDB 24-character hex ObjectIds. The
ai-service pads them to 32 chars to form Qdrant point ids and strips the pad
back on read, so the ids returned by ``SearchPosts`` / cited by ``ChatAnswer``
are exactly these 24-hex strings. Every ``post_id`` here follows that format;
an evaluation run must index exactly these ids so cited ids line up with
``expected_post_ids``.

Row categories
--------------
* ``grounded``     -- a real question about the platform; expects one or more
                      cited post ids from the corpus.
* ``gibberish``    -- nonsense input; the assistant should retrieve nothing
                      and cite no posts (``expected_post_ids == []``).
* ``out_of_scope`` -- a coherent question unrelated to the platform; the
                      assistant should also cite nothing.

Every grounded row names the corpus posts that answer it. The build script
turns each row into a LangSmith example (inputs = query + history, outputs =
expected_post_ids + category) so evaluators can score citation accuracy.
